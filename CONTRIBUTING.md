# Contributing to Lingarr

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lingarr!   
This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- .NET SDK (for build scripts)
- Docker (for running the application)
- PowerShell (for build scripts)

### Getting Started
1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[USERNAME]/lingarr.git
cd lingarr
```

3. Add the upstream repository as a remote:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/lingarr-translate/lingarr.git
```

4. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix-name
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

- `Lingarr.Server/`: Backend application
- `Lingarr.Core/`: Core domain models and interfaces
- `Lingarr.Client/`: Vue.js frontend application
- `Lingarr.Migrations.SQLite/`: SQLite database migrations
- `Lingarr.Migrations.MySQL/`: MySQL database migrations

## Building and Testing

### Development
Navigate to the root directory and start up the project:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Configure and sync with Sonarr and Radarr to create test data.   
The frontend supports hot reload while the backend needs to be rebuilt each time a change has been made.

- Implement proper error handling
- Document public APIs using XML comments
- Use dependency injection where appropriate
